Continuing the idea of MyCalendar, we want to check two event ahead and two event. But it fails at the test cases where there's an identical event added, the comparison of checking previous event (itself) and post event (itself) will always be false and causing the answer to be false negative. Taking a look at other people's solution gives me better understanding of how this should be approached.
