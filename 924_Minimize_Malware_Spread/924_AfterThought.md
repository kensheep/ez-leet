Very typical union-find problem, I learned this first lesson from Algorithms class from Professor Sedgewick in Coursera. Using both weight and path compression, each root() call is O(lg*N) time, which is the log of the log of N, one can practically deem it as constant time. Constructing the UF is O(N^2) from the adjacency matrix.
Hard part is how to "disconnect" the initial node from UF. Turns out you don't need to implement disconnect(), but rather what you want to do is: after constructing the UF, examine each cluster and see if there is one and only one initial node. If it is more than one node, removing any initial won't stop the spread. For the ones with one initial node, choose the biggest cluster and the initial node in it is the winner.
